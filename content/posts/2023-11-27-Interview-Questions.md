Interview questions are nothing like what you're going to face in your day-to-day job.
While every company will ask you different questions, the main gist remains the same. How well are you prepared.  
You can view technical interviews as entry exams. The job description? Exam syllabus.
To be fair, put yourself in the recruiter's shoes. 
They receive *many* requests and have to find someone suitable in the shortest and most efficient manner. 
Are technical interviews the 'best' way to do it? Probably not. But they yield consistent results.

So, the natural thing to do is to study beforehand, practice your responses and gain experience.  
In this post, I'm going to gather some questions you may be asked for **mid-level Go backend developer** positions. 
It is by no means not exhaustive and questions are mostly found online. I haven't included answers as well.
My thinking is: gain easy, lose easy. You need to know these questions and their respectable answers by heart.
In my experience, the best approach is for you to go in some trouble into finding answers.
Search online, ask your coworkers, reflect on your response, write down your points and remarks.

## Last Words

So many questions. Too many, in fact. Your purpose shouldn't be to cover them all in one go.  
The best approach, I would think, is to keep revisiting them frequently. Each time, focus on a few. 
Try to broaden your knowledge on the matter, read about it and some more on similar subjects. 
If it's something you're not familiar with, put time to explore it and learn about its concepts. 

Keep in mind, interviewers are trying to gauge your abilities and experiences. 
All these questions are simply a starting point, discussion opener. If you don't know the response, don't be afraid to admit it!  
Ask for guidance. Include the interviewer in the conversation. Query for their inputs. Demonstrate how well you can communicate. 
Maybe you did a project related to something similar? Or you once used a tool reminiscing to this one? 

I wish you luck! As always, feel free to let me know what you think.
Share some questions you were asked, or any thoughts you have on these questions.

Cheers, Hossein :)
